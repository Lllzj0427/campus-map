# campus-map

This project is part of the Data Structures class (CS 251) at UIC, taught by Professor Joseph Hummel.

This C++ console-based program is designed for inputting a campus map, specifically tailored for locations like UIC's East campus. The primary functionality involves guiding two individuals situated in distinct buildings towards a designated "meeting point" within a "preferred" building, using the available footways.
